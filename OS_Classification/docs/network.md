# Network Operating System

Designed primarily to support devices connected to a LAN (local area network). These provide multiple processes such as:

* Printer Sharing
* File System Sharing
* Database Sharing
* Application Sharing
* Network Security

These tend to be enhancements such as Novell Netware and Microsoft Windows Server that add on to Interactive Operating System.
