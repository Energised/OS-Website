#Server Operating Systems

This is a system that, much like a network operating system, can provide its networked clinets with some specific
services. These don't tend to use a GUI since it's more expensive and takes up processing power.

The most common kind of server is a client-server system, where multiple clients are connected to one or more server
that they can request for files, services etc.
