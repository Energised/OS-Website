# Device Operating Systems

Certain devices may require the use of an operating system to interact with their hardware in order to perform multiple
tasks, with their benefits including:

* The ability to multi-task
* The ability to operate in real=time
* It is easier to add new applications
* Applications can be developed elsewhere and then installed
* The entire OS can be replaced

## Mobile Devices 

Operating systems for mobile devices such as PDA's and smartphones have to meet different requirements to PC's. Some only
have to perform one task, and will run a piece of firmware rather than an entire OS (which could be deemed as overkill). 
These devices have limitations though, so must run a lightweight operating system in order to run all the hardware we 
now expect on a smartphone.
