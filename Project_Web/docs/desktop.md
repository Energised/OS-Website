#Desktop Operating System

###DEFINITION

`An operating system that allows the user to carry out a 
broad range of general purpose tasks`

These are the most sophisticated systems, since they have to manage multiple pieces or hardware. The systems must
have support for a wide range of hardware along with a mass of network protocols. These operating systems tend
to be written in a modular structure for ease of access to developers.

The main issue with desktop operating systems is their size and memory usage. Bespoke software solutions can
require a large amount of storage space which, run in parallel with an operating system, can cause significant
load time issues amoungst other problems.
